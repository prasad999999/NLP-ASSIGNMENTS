Unit IV: Information Retrieval using NLP

Lab Assignment 1: Implementing the Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval
•	Implement a simple search engine using the TF-IDF vectorization method.
•	Use a small dataset of documents and allow the user to input a query.
•	Compute cosine similarity to retrieve the most relevant documents.
•	Use Scikit-learn’s TfidfVectorizer for vectorization.

Lab Assignment 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy
•	Load a dataset containing text (news articles, Wikipedia snippets, etc.).
•	Use spaCy to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER).
•	Extract and classify named entities (Person, Organization, Date, etc.).
•	Visualize the extracted entities using displaCy.
